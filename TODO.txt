- squares anim when frank (8 squares) or monster dies (4 squares) vary colors
 - next level when all fruits eaten
 - 3 lives then game over
 - add a small probability for monsters to reverse dir
 
 - monster should stop a bit when hitting a wall or another monster
 - sometimes Frank pushes through an apple when it is blocked by a monster
 - make sure all fruits are accessible
 - apple slow fall should be slower => not to kill Frank when eating fruit below
 - slowest speedFactor should be slower (ok now?)
 - redo all screenshots,
   * not using "ActiveX streching in WinAPE"...
   * using "half display size"
   * full screen screenshot, cut things in Krita, zoomed
   * then shring all images by 2 horizontally
